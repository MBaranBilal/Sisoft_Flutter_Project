# Add New Patient
I have filled "Hasta Ekle" page with the necessary fields.
User can add a new patient now.
All fields are validated.
Placeholder values can be replaced with real values.

For now, adding a new patient is runtime only, no database or server used here.
The page is fully functional.
## Changes
Properties of the class Hasta has been changed with necessary fields. Some of them are required as it should be.
Also HastaEklePage class has changed. 
There is no change with other classes and algorithms. 

## What Should Done?
Since the rest of the program is not belong to me and made by other people, I have not changed the main structure at all. I have just implemented my static page.
main.dart script is too long and messy. It contains lots of fields and classes that can be seperated.
